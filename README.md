# AS - Resolution of Algorithmic Problems

<br>

## Description
Resolution of problems related to different algorithms, like recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy and graph algorithms, branch and bound, etc. 

### Technologies:
- C++
- Java

<br>

## Information
This repository includes the resolution of several problems, but is focused on 3 projects:
- Project 1: Impossible Puzzle (Backtracking)
- Project 2: Pyramid Scheme (Bottom-up Approach)
- Project 3: Analyzing a Data Pipeline (DFS, BFS, Topological Sorting, Dijkstra Algorithm)

The analysis and explanation of our approaches are focused on their correctness and temporal and spatial complexity.
